# ui5-mobx-state-tree-examples

These are demos of applying MobX and MobX state tree in a UI5 app - originally accompanying a talk from UI5CON 2019 "Structured UI5 state management with MobX state tree".

[Demo 1](https://sammok83.github.io/ui5-mobx-state-tree-examples/demo1_jsonmodel/webapp/index.html) shows a basic application that uses a JSON model.

[Demo 2](https://sammok83.github.io/ui5-mobx-state-tree-examples/demo2_mobx/webapp/index.html) shows the same application, but instead uses MobX under the hood.

[Demo 3](https://sammok83.github.io/ui5-mobx-state-tree-examples/demo3_mobx-state-tree/webapp/index.html) is once again the same application, but now using MobX state tree.

[Demo 4](https://sammok83.github.io/ui5-mobx-state-tree-examples/demo4_mobx-state-tree_history/webapp/index.html) adds a history slider to the application.
